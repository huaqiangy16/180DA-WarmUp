a) I can use my given speech program to detect words from the user and compare it to the result from the program.

b) The complexity of my speech recognition would be simply recognize the words speak from the user and return the result as quickly as possible.

c) I need it quickly enough so that it doesn't make a delay more than 5 seconds; however, a missed recognition will not hurt the progress of the game as it will provide another chance for the user to speak again.

d) I am considering using a mic to reduce the noise in the surrounding so that it provides an imporvement in the accuracy of the speech recoginition.
